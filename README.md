# TrinityOS
TrinityOS is a free and open source hobbyist OS I have been working on since Febuary 2021.

# V.0721 Update
The V.0721 Update (aka the July update) brings a new way windows run within TrinityOS. With the introduction to the Stopwatch app (an app that counts from 0 to 60 then resets), windows manager now allows apps to have information inside them update constantly.
Another exciting feature is the introcution to TrinityOS Defender, a program designed to keep programs from accessing system calls without corrrect permissions, making TrinityOS much more secure.

# V.0621 Update
The V.0621 Update (aka the June update) brings many new back end additions, such as a makefile, custom libraries, start of a userland, and many others. There is also a slight visual change in the desktop background color.

# Developer's Note
New security  updates will be a part of the monthly updates for TrinityOS.
