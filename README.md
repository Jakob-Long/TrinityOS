# TrinityOS
TrinityOS is a free and open source hobbyist OS I have been working on since Febuary 2021.

# V.0621 Update
The V.0621 Update (aka the June update) brings many new back end additions, such as a makefile, custom libraries, start of a userland, and many others. There is also a slight visual change in the desktop background color.

# Developer's Note
I apologize for these updates not being as significant. As the school year has been wrapping up, things have gotten incredably busy, so I barely get any time to sit down and work on TrinityOS.
