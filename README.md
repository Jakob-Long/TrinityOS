# TrinityOS
TrinityOS is a free and open source hobbyist OS I have been working on since Febuary 2021.

# V.1221 Update
The V.1221 Updata (aka the December update) brings a whole set of new features. With the new introduction to keyboard support, TrinityOS becomes more interactive. This new keboard integration brough about new ways to use TrinityOS, such as: Desktop Mode, Text/Command Mode, and the all new Text Editor app. The new text editor app allows you to write whatever you wish, making TrinityOS much more interesting. The VGA driver and Window Manager also got completely redesigned, allowing for a more bug free experience. There has also been a redesign of the desktop, with the introduction of the taskbar at the bottom of the screen.

# V.0721 Update
The V.0721 Update (aka the July update) brings a new way windows run within TrinityOS. With the introduction to the Stopwatch app (an app that counts from 0 to 60 then resets), windows manager now allows apps to have information inside them update constantly.
Another exciting feature is the introcution to TrinityOS Defender, a program designed to keep programs from accessing system calls without corrrect permissions, making TrinityOS much more secure.

# V.0621 Update
The V.0621 Update (aka the June update) brings many new back end additions, such as a makefile, custom libraries, start of a userland, and many others. There is also a slight visual change in the desktop background color.

# Developer's Note
Sadly, I was unable to get TrinityOS running on actual hardware in time for the V.1121 update, but keep your hopes up for next month :^)
