# V.0422 Update
The V.0422 Update (aka the April 2022 update) introduces a few new beta features. TFS (Temporary File System), is a simple version of a RAM file system (more functionality coming soon.) There is also the introduction of the new Quick Menu. The Module Subsystem has also been redesigned to be more functional.

# V.0122 Update
The V.0122 Update (aka the January 2022 update) brings about a new way to make apps for TrinityOS. With the introduction of the module subsystem, you can now easily create apps and programs for TrinityOS, without having to understand the entire source code. Modules are loaded into the kernel during boot, and are easily executable within Text Mode. Along with that, there are some new additions to the desktop. When you close a window, it now displays the window title in the taskbar. There is also a new Christas theme to TrinityOS.

# V.1221 Update
The V.1221 Update (aka the December update) brings a whole set of new features. With the new introduction to keyboard support, TrinityOS becomes more interactive. This new keboard integration brough about new ways to use TrinityOS, such as: Desktop Mode, Text/Command Mode, and the all new Text Editor app. The new text editor app allows you to write whatever you wish, making TrinityOS much more interesting. The VGA driver and Window Manager also got completely redesigned, allowing for a more bug free experience. There has also been a redesign of the desktop, with the introduction of the taskbar at the bottom of the screen.

# V.0721 Update
The V.0721 Update (aka the July update) brings a new way windows run within TrinityOS. With the introduction to the Stopwatch app (an app that counts from 0 to 60 then resets), windows manager now allows apps to have information inside them update constantly.
Another exciting feature is the introcution to TrinityOS Defender, a program designed to keep programs from accessing system calls without corrrect permissions, making TrinityOS much more secure.

# V.0621 Update
