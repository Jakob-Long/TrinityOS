 How to make bootable USB

 4: Select your USB device
 5: For boot selection, choose the ISO in the "img" folder in the V.0522 source code (V.0522/img/TrinityOS.iso)
 6: Click start and choose WRITE IN DD IMAGE MODE.
 
 
 Note: Writing in DD image mode is the only way to get it to work, however your USB drive will not be able to be
